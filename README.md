The Current Richmond Makers Forum is a facebook chat page.
It's a contstant feed of information that streams by minute by minute. Memebers complain that 
once events scroll off the bottom of the feed it is difficult to find again.

The memebers of the Richmond Makers want a place where all events are collected in one spot.  
A place where people can sign up and commit to attending an event.
A place where they can also checkout each others portfolios before going.

This is an attempt to solve that by putting all events in once place and
connecting event attendees to a profile/portfolio that can be reviewed by other members.


Future Features: 

1. Larger Overal categorized chat room
